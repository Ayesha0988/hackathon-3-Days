# Project Activities:
We worked on this Nike shoe marketplace project over several days, from planning to launching it online. Here's what we did:

# Day 1:
Planning: We figured out what kind of online store we wanted to build (a place to buy and sell Nike shoes), who would use it, what would make it special (fast shipping, good prices, lots of choices), and how we'd organize all the information.

# Day 2:
Customer Activities:
✅ Login/Register
✅ Search & Filter Products
✅ View Product Details (description, price, stock, reviews)
✅ Add Product to Cart (dynamic updates)
✅ Proceed to Checkout (enter shipping details & select delivery option)
✅ Make Payment (Online Payment / Cash on Delivery)
✅ Track Shipment (real-time tracking updates)
✅ Receive Order & Logout

Admin Activities:
✅ Add Categories & Products
✅ Manage Orders & Bills
✅ Generate & View Reports

System Activities:
✅ Process Order in Warehouse
✅ Handle Secure Payments via Payment Gateway
✅ Fetch Product Data via APIs
✅ Track Shipments via Third-Party APIs

# Day 3: 
Organizing Information: We planned how to keep track of all the details about the shoes, customers, and orders.  Think of it like setting up a filing system.  For example, for each shoe, we'd store its ID number, name, price, and how many we have. We did the same for customers, shipments, and delivery areas, and figured out how it all connects.

# Day 4: 
Building the Web Pages: We built the actual web pages people would see, including parts for showing products, product details, shopping carts, and maybe user accounts. We made sure they looked good and were easy to use, and connected them to the information we were storing.

# Day 5:
Making it Reliable: We tested everything carefully to make sure it worked smoothly. We added ways to handle errors gracefully, so if something goes wrong, users see helpful messages. We also fine-tuned the connection to make sure it was fast and secure.

# Day 6: 
Going Live: We put the project online!  Now people can actually visit the website.  We also set up some secret keys (environment variables) to keep important information like passwords safe.

# Day 7:
Key Activities
✅ Secure Configuration – Protected environment variables & enabled HTTPS.
✅ Performance Optimization – Minimized assets, enabled caching & lazy loading.
✅ Monitoring & Maintenance – Integrated Sentry for error tracking & analytics.
✅ Future Enhancements – Improve scalability & implement CI/CD for updates.
